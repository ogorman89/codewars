// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
    one: {
    name: 'bedroom',
    description: 'has a bed',
    completed: false
    },
    two: {
    name: 'kitchen',
    description: 'has food',
    completed: false
    },
    three: {
    name: 'bathroom',
    description: 'has a shower',
    completed: false
    }
  }
